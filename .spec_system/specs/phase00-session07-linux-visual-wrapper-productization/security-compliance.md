# Security & Compliance Report

**Session ID**: `phase00-session07-linux-visual-wrapper-productization`
**Reviewed**: 2026-07-03
**Result**: PASS

## Scope

**Files reviewed** (session deliverables and touched runtime/test/docs files):
- `README.md` - visual mode user documentation
- `src/apex_infinite_visual/__init__.py` - wrapper package exports
- `src/apex_infinite_visual/events.py` - wrapper event parsing and state mapping
- `src/apex_infinite_visual/launcher.py` - guarded subprocess launcher
- `src/apex_infinite_visual/main.py` - PySide6 bridge and wrapper entrypoint
- `src/apex_infinite_visual/qml/Main.qml` - visual wrapper QML surface
- `src/apex_infinite_visual/settings.py` - wrapper settings validation
- `requirements-wrapper.txt` - optional wrapper dependencies
- `tests/test_visual_wrapper_productization.py` - productization tests
- `tests/test_visual_wrapper_spike.py` - updated spike compatibility tests
- `docs/operator-runbook.md` - operator guidance
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - wrapper recovery guidance
- `docs/visual-wrapper-boundary.md` - clean-room and release boundary
- `docs/visual-wrapper-productization.md` - productization guide

**Review method**: Static analysis of session deliverables, dependency check, source inspection, and security/GDPR checklist review.

**Review evidence**:
- Command/check: `rg -n "sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}|Bearer [A-Za-z0-9._-]{10,}|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|(?i)(api[_-]?key|secret|token|password)\s*[:=]\s*['\"][^'\"]+" src/apex_infinite_visual tests/test_visual_wrapper_productization.py tests/test_visual_wrapper_spike.py docs/visual-wrapper-productization.md requirements-wrapper.txt README.md docs/operator-runbook.md docs/troubleshooting.md docs/visual-wrapper-boundary.md || true`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: matches were documented `api_key` environment placeholder examples in README and deliberate unsafe `Bearer abcdef1234567890` rejection fixtures in tests; no live hardcoded credential was found.
- Command/check: `rg -n "subprocess|Popen|shell=True|os\.system|eval\(|exec\(|sqlite3|open\(" src/apex_infinite_visual tests/test_visual_wrapper_productization.py`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: subprocess usage is centralized in `launcher.py`; `Popen` receives a list command, no `shell=True`, no `os.system`, no `eval`, and no DB writes in wrapper code.
- Command/check: `sed -n '1,260p' src/apex_infinite_visual/launcher.py`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: CLI script and project path are resolved and validated before launch; stdout is guarded with `--event-stream - --machine-output`; process cleanup terminates or kills the child on timeout.
- Command/check: `sed -n '480,610p' src/apex_infinite_visual/main.py`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: stderr is mapped through `_stderr_summary`, timeouts and non-zero exits become synthetic product-facing events, and broad wrapper exceptions expose only the exception class name.
- Command/check: `python -m pip check` from `./`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: output was `No broken requirements found.`
- Command/check: `rg -n "sqlite|schema|migration|CREATE TABLE|ALTER TABLE|DB_|history\.db|WAL|PRAGMA" ... || true`
  - Result: N/A
  - Evidence: matches were documentation references to existing history behavior only; the session did not add DB-layer code, schema changes, migrations, or data-shape changes.
- Command/check: `rg -n "debug|telemetry|seed|frame|resize|readiness|route owner|shell ready|version label|data-source|scaffold|TODO|FIXME" src/apex_infinite_visual/qml/Main.qml src/apex_infinite_visual/main.py || true`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: no normal product-surface diagnostics or scaffolding terms were found.

## Security Assessment

### Overall: PASS

| Category | Status | Severity | Details |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Injection (SQLi, CMDi, LDAPi) | PASS | -- | No SQL/LDAP code was added. Subprocess launch uses a list command with validated source-tree CLI and project paths; no `shell=True` or `os.system` usage was found. |
| Hardcoded Secrets | PASS | -- | Secret scan found only README environment placeholder examples and tests that verify unsafe token strings are rejected. |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | PASS | -- | Raw subprocess stderr is summarized before display; event validation rejects ANSI/control/secret-like payload strings; docs keep API keys environment-backed. |
| Insecure Dependencies | PASS | -- | Optional dependency file remains wrapper-only, and `pip check` reported no broken requirements. |
| Security Misconfiguration | PASS | -- | PySide6/QML dependencies stay outside base `requirements.txt`; no debug mode, permissive network setting, or public service exposure was introduced. |

### Security Findings

No security findings.
