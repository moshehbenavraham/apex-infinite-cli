| Database/schema | `rg -n "sqlite|schema|migration|CREATE TABLE|ALTER TABLE|DB_|history\.db|WAL|PRAGMA" ... || true` | N/A | Matches were documentation references to existing history behavior only; no DB-layer implementation or migration changed. |

| Conventions | `.spec_system/CONVENTIONS.md` inspection plus commands above | PASS | New Python follows black/pylint, wrapper remains optional, tests are focused, docs were updated, and base CLI dependency boundary is preserved. |
| Security/GDPR | `security-compliance.md` checklist evidence | PASS/N/A | Security PASS; GDPR N/A because no new personal-data handling was introduced. |
| Behavioral quality | `sed -n` inspections of `launcher.py`, `main.py`, `events.py`, `settings.py`, `Main.qml`; `rg -n "def test_bridge_prevents_duplicate_start|..." tests/test_visual_wrapper_productization.py` | PASS | Inputs are validated, subprocess resources are cleaned up, duplicate starts are prevented, failures map to explicit states, and contracts are covered by focused tests. |
| UI product surface | `rg -n "debug|telemetry|seed|frame|resize|readiness|route owner|shell ready|version label|data-source|scaffold|TODO|FIXME" src/apex_infinite_visual/qml/Main.qml src/apex_infinite_visual/main.py || true`; offscreen smoke command above | PASS | No diagnostic/scaffolding terms found; offscreen QML launch completed successfully. |

## 1. Code Review Gate

### Status: PASS

**Report**: `code-review.md`
**Result**: RESOLVED
**Issues**: None unresolved.

The review report covers all implementation, test, documentation, and session artifacts changed since base commit `6f774b606856a75d372d62f090575a1eead0b614` before validation artifacts were generated. Generated validation artifacts and the validation state update are produced by this command and are not part of the prior `creview` surface.

| File Set | Encoding | Line Endings | Status |
|----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| 13 spec deliverables | ASCII/text | LF | PASS |
| 19 changed/session files | ASCII/text or JSON text | LF | PASS |

**Encoding issues**: None

## 5. Test Results

### Status: PASS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tests | 221 |
| Passed | 221 |
| Failed | 0 |
| Coverage | Not configured for this validation command |

**Failed tests**: None

Additional quality gates passed: black check, pylint, py_compile, QML lint, and offscreen wrapper smoke. QML lint exits 0 with known non-blocking unqualified-access warnings already recorded by `creview`.

## 6. Database/Schema Alignment

### Status: N/A

**Evidence**: `rg -n "sqlite|schema|migration|CREATE TABLE|ALTER TABLE|DB_|history\.db|WAL|PRAGMA" ... || true` found only documentation references to existing history behavior. No DB-layer implementation, migration, schema artifact, seed, index, persisted data shape, or generated type changed in this session.

**Issues found**: None

## 7. Success Criteria

From `spec.md`:

**Functional requirements**:
- Optional visual mode launches from source and consumes dry-run events through JSONL boundary: PASS - offscreen smoke command exited 0.
- Wrapper settings expose green CRT, amber CRT, IBM DOS, and plain presets plus effect intensity, font, scale, reduced effects, and plain fallback controls: PASS - settings tests and QML/static inspections found the controls.
- Missing CLI, missing PySide6, display-backend failure, malformed JSONL, subprocess stderr, non-zero exit, timeout, and stop states are visible product-facing states: PASS - focused tests and `rg` evidence found the mapped states.
- Base CLI install and normal terminal execution remain free of PySide6, QML, graphical imports, and wrapper assets: PASS - base CLI isolation `rg` produced no output and import-isolation tests passed.
- Linux setup, packaging, release, license, checksum, source/relink, and troubleshooting instructions are documented before release verification: PASS - docs `rg` found the required topics.

**Testing requirements**:
- Settings, launcher, timeout, stderr/return-code, duplicate start, malformed event, fixture flow, bridge reset, controls, and import guard behavior: PASS - `tests/test_visual_wrapper_productization.py` and `tests/test_visual_wrapper_spike.py` passed.
- Offscreen wrapper smoke: PASS - `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python -m apex_infinite_visual.main --dry-run --max-iterations 1 --auto-close-ms 300` exited 0.
- Existing CLI tests: PASS - 221/221 pytest tests passed.

**Quality gates**:
- ASCII and LF: PASS.
- Code conventions: PASS.
- Primary user-facing wrapper surface contains product-facing copy only: PASS.
- Diagnostics remain in tests, docs, logs, or explicit failure surfaces: PASS.

## 8. Conventions Compliance

### Status: PASS

**Categories spot-checked**: naming, file structure, error handling, comments, testing, documentation, optional visual wrapper boundary, and database conventions.

**Convention violations**: None

Evidence: black/pylint/py_compile passed; optional PySide6/QML imports remain lazy and wrapper-only; base `requirements.txt` is free of wrapper dependencies; tests use fixture and monkeypatch patterns; docs were updated for user-facing visual mode behavior; no DB schema changes were made.

## 9. Security & GDPR Compliance

### Status: PASS/N/A

**Full report**: See `security-compliance.md` in this session directory.

#### Summary

| Area | Status | Findings |
|------|--------|----------|
| Security | PASS | 0 issues |
| GDPR | N/A | 0 issues |

**Critical violations**: None

**Categories spot-checked**: trust boundaries, resource cleanup, mutation safety, failure paths, contract alignment, and product surface discipline.

**Violations found**: None

**Fixes applied during validation**: None

## 11. UI Product-Surface Spot-Check
