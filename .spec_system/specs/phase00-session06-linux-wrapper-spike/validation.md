## 5. Test Results
### Status: PASS
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tests | 189 |
| Passed | 189 |
| Failed | 0 |
| Coverage | N/A - coverage threshold not configured for this validation command |

**Failed tests**: None

Additional quality checks:
- `black --check`: PASS.
- `pylint`: PASS, 10.00/10.
- `py_compile`: PASS.
- Offscreen wrapper smoke: PASS.
- `pyside6-qmllint`: PASS exit 0 with non-blocking unqualified-access warnings.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

## 6. Database/Schema Alignment
### Status: N/A

**Evidence**: The session changed an optional wrapper, tests, and docs. It did
not change persisted data shape, constraints, indexes, migrations, seeds, or
database access code. The schema search found only documentation references to
existing history/schema behavior.

**Issues found**: None

## 7. Success Criteria
From spec.md:

**Functional requirements**:
- PASS - Wrapper prototype launches fixture/dry-run events through JSONL:
  offscreen smoke exited 0 and tests cover fixture event flow.
- PASS - QML surface includes read-only event log, status panels, theme
  selection, reduced effects, and effect toggles: `Main.qml` inspection and
  smoke verified the prototype surface.
- PASS - Launcher builds guarded `--event-stream - --machine-output` commands
  and keeps stderr separate: launcher inspection and wrapper tests verified the
  guard.
- PASS - Event adapter accepts current events and maps malformed input to
  explicit error state: wrapper tests cover valid events, malformed JSON,
  unsupported versions, unsafe payloads, and adapter recovery.
- PASS - Spike document records PySide6/QML acceptance, blockers, and backup
  criteria: `visual-wrapper-spike.md` includes the decision record and license
  evidence.

**Testing requirements**:
- PASS - Unit tests cover parsing, ordering, malformed JSON, unsupported
  versions, launcher construction, stdout guard, dependency guard, and fixture
  flow through `tests/test_visual_wrapper_spike.py`.
- PASS - Offscreen wrapper smoke completed with
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python -m apex_infinite_visual.main --dry-run --max-iterations 1 --auto-close-ms 300`.
- PASS - Existing CLI tests remain passing: 189/189 tests passed.

**Quality gates**:
- PASS - ASCII-only and LF-only deliverables verified.
- PASS - Code follows conventions based on black, pylint, tests, and targeted
  convention inspection.
- PASS - Primary wrapper surface contains product-facing copy only.
- PASS - Diagnostics remain in tests, docs, logs, or explicit failure states.

## 8. Conventions Compliance
### Status: PASS

**Categories spot-checked**: naming, file structure, error handling, comments,
testing, database conventions, optional wrapper dependency boundary,
documentation, and clean-room visual rules.

**Convention violations**: None blocking. `pyside6-qmllint` exits 0 with
unqualified-access suggestions only; the project does not configure those as a
blocking gate, and the offscreen QML smoke passes.

## 9. Security & GDPR Compliance
### Status: PASS
**Full report**: See `security-compliance.md` in this session directory.

#### Summary
| Area | Status | Findings |
|------|--------|----------|
| Security | PASS | 0 issues |
| GDPR | N/A | 0 issues |

**Critical violations**: None

- `tests/test_visual_wrapper_spike.py`

**Categories spot-checked**: trust boundaries, resource cleanup, mutation
safety, failure paths, contract alignment, accessibility, and product surface.

**Violations found**: None

**Fixes applied during validation**: None

## 11. UI Product-Surface Spot-Check
### Status: PASS

**Surfaces inspected**: `src/apex_infinite_visual/qml/Main.qml` by code inspection,
plus offscreen wrapper load through the dry-run route.
**Diagnostics found in primary UI**: None
**Allowed debug/admin surfaces**: None
