# Security & Compliance Report

**Session ID**: `phase00-session08-release-verification`
**Reviewed**: 2026-07-03
**Result**: PASS

## Scope

**Files reviewed**:
- `.spec_system/SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md` - cumulative security posture refresh.
- `.spec_system/state.json` - spec-system workflow state.
- `README.md` - CLI release documentation.
- `src/apex_infinite/cli.py` - notification behavior fix.
- `tests/test_cli_options.py` - focused regression test.
- `docs/operator-runbook.md` - operator release guidance.
- `docs/visual-wrapper-productization.md` - wrapper release posture.
- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session08-release-verification/clean-room-audit.md` - clean-room audit.
- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session08-release-verification/code-review.md` - code review report.
- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session08-release-verification/compatibility-fixes.md` - fix ledger.
- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session08-release-verification/implementation-notes.md` - implementation ledger.
- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session08-release-verification/release-verification.md` - release verification ledger.
- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session08-release-verification/spec.md` - session spec.
- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session08-release-verification/tasks.md` - session task checklist.

**Review method**: Static review of changed files, command evidence from the release
ledger, targeted security checklist, dependency audit, secret/reference scans,
and focused inspection of the runtime code diff.

**Review evidence**:
- Command/check: `python -m pip_audit -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements-wrapper.txt`
  - Result: PASS - no known vulnerabilities found.
- Command/check: `rg -n 'PySide6|Qt|QML|Nuitka|pyside6|qml|qtquick|QtQuick' requirements.txt src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/events.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py || true`
  - Result: PASS - no base CLI graphical dependency or import hits.
- Command/check: `rg -n 'api_key|sk-[A-Za-z0-9]|Bearer [A-Za-z0-9]|password|secret|token|private_key|BEGIN .*KEY' ...`
  - Result: PASS - hits are documented risk text, environment variable examples, and `ollama` test fixtures; no hardcoded real secret found.
- Command/check: `git diff -- src/apex_infinite/cli.py tests/test_cli_options.py`
  - Result: PASS - runtime change is limited to gating terminal BEL output on `sys.stdout.isatty()` plus a focused regression test.
- Command/check: NUL-safe tracked reference-material scans with `git ls-files -z ... | xargs -0 rg ...`
  - Result: PASS - no tracked `EXAMPLE/` files or binary/reference extensions; excluded-component hits are documentation only.
- Command/check: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
  - Result: PASS - 222 tests passed, including event safety, history raw-storage, prompt routing, output fallback, and wrapper tests.

## Security Assessment

### Overall: PASS

| Category | Status | Severity | Details |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Injection | PASS | -- | The changed runtime path does not introduce SQL or shell parsing. `notify()` still invokes `notify-send` with an argument list and `shell=False` default. |
| Hardcoded Secrets | PASS | -- | Secret scan found only documentation risk text, env-var examples, and `ollama` test fixture values. |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | PASS | -- | The compatibility fix prevents terminal BEL control bytes from leaking into redirected logs and machine-readable wrapper paths. Existing raw-history risk is documented as an open cumulative posture item, not newly introduced personal data handling. |
| Insecure Dependencies | PASS | -- | `pip-audit` reported no known vulnerabilities across base, dev, and optional wrapper requirements. |
| Security Misconfiguration | PASS | -- | No debug mode, CORS, header, or deployment config was introduced. Machine-output/event guard tests passed. |
| Database Security | N/A | -- | No DB schema, query, migration, or persisted data shape changed in this session. Existing history tests passed. |

### Security Findings

No security findings.

## GDPR Compliance Assessment

### Overall: N/A

N/A because this session did not introduce new personal data collection,
storage, consent handling, erasure behavior, or third-party data transfer.
The cumulative posture document continues to record local history and provider
data-transfer risks for future work.

**Categories reviewed**: Data Collection & Purpose, Consent Mechanism, Data
Minimization, Right to Erasure, PII in Logs, Third-Party Data Transfers.

### Personal Data Inventory

No personal data collected or processed in this session.

### GDPR Findings

No GDPR findings.

## Recommendations

- Keep the four cumulative WATCH findings in `.spec_system/SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md` open for future scoped sessions.
- Before any binary wrapper release, complete concrete artifact license, notice, checksum, source/relink, and generated-bundle review.
