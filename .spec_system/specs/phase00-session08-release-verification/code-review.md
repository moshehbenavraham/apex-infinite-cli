## Findings by Severity

### Critical

None.

### High

None.

### Medium

None.

### Low

- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session08-release-verification/clean-room-audit.md:66` - Wrapper release-state rows still described the T021 rerun as incomplete even though T021 passed and the release status is complete. | Fix: changed both wrapper entrypoint and QML lint rows to say the T021 rerun passed. | Status: FIXED
- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session08-release-verification/release-verification.md:237` - Event-file and machine-stdout smoke rows still used pre-run planning language even though T013 passed and the final gate is complete. | Fix: changed both row statuses to PASS. | Status: FIXED
- `.spec_system/SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md:138` - Phase history still described both review and validation as incomplete after the review had resolved its findings. | Fix: updated the status to show review complete and validation pending. | Status: FIXED

## Assumptions and Deliberate Non-Fixes

- QML lint emits existing unqualified-access warnings from unchanged QML code, exits 0, and is already recorded in the release ledger as non-blocking. No QML file changed in this review surface, so this creview did not refactor that already-known warning class.
- Linux visual wrapper binary/AppImage publication remains intentionally gated by the Session 08 spec and release ledger. That is a documented release position, not a creview blocker.
- The Session 08 planning spec keeps its original success-criteria checklist. Completion evidence lives in `tasks.md`, `implementation-notes.md`, and `release-verification.md`; `validate` owns the next formal validation report.

## Behavior Changes

- The implementation under review changes `notify()` so terminal BEL is written only for interactive stdout. This preserves interactive notification behavior while preventing live-only control bytes from leaking into redirected logs, plain output captures, and wrapper/machine-output paths.
- This creview added no further runtime behavior changes.

## Verification

- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v` - PASS - 222 tests passed.
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v` - PASS - 61 Bats tests passed.
- Root checks: `bash .spec_system/scripts/analyze-project.sh --json` - PASS - plugin payload is current.
- Root checks: `bash .spec_system/scripts/analyze-project.sh --json | jq .` - PASS - analyzer reports Session 08 as current and seven sessions complete.
- Root checks: `bash .spec_system/scripts/check-prereqs.sh --json --env | jq .` - PASS - overall prereq status is pass.
- Formatter: `python -m black --check src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/events.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py apex_infinite_visual tests` - PASS - 20 files unchanged.
- Linter: `python -m pylint src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/events.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py apex_infinite_visual` - PASS - 10.00/10.
- Type checker: N/A - no Python type checker is configured.
- Compile: `python -m py_compile src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/events.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py src/apex_infinite_visual/*.py` - PASS.
- QML lint: `pyside6-qmllint src/apex_infinite_visual/qml/Main.qml` - PASS - exited 0 with known unqualified-access warnings.
- Wrapper smoke: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python -m apex_infinite_visual.main --dry-run --max-iterations 1 --auto-close-ms 300` - PASS.
- Whitespace: `git diff --check` - PASS.
- ASCII/LF scan: changed-file scan - PASS - 14 changed files used ASCII and LF only.
- Stale-status scan: checked for the three stale release-status phrases fixed above - PASS - no matches after fixes.
- Final diff re-read: no remaining issues found in the reviewed uncommitted changes.

## Summary

1. Reviewed all uncommitted changes: 7 tracked modifications, 6 new Session 08 artifacts, and this creview report.
2. Findings: 0 critical, 0 high, 0 medium, 3 low; all low findings were stale status text in release/security ledgers and were fixed.
3. Deliberately not fixed: known QML lint warnings from unchanged QML, binary/AppImage publication gates, and the original planning-spec checklist.
4. Verification passed: full CLI pytest, root Bats, payload sync, analyzer, prereqs, black, pylint, compile, QML lint, offscreen wrapper smoke, diff check, ASCII/LF scan, and final stale-status scan.
