# Code Review and Repair Report

**Session ID**: `phase00-session04-event-stream-boundary`
**Reviewed**: 2026-07-03
**Base Commit**: `6751558da5df70d3a5baef6347506526ef166f63` (`HEAD` fallback; `spec.md` has no `Base Commit` field)
**Scope**: All changes since the base commit (uncommitted work plus mid-session commits)
**Result**: RESOLVED

**Inventory commands**: `git status`, `git log --oneline "$BASE"..HEAD`, `git diff "$BASE"`, `git diff --cached "$BASE"`, `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`

No staged changes or mid-session commits were present. Six untracked text files were read fully before repair work; this report is the seventh untracked file and was reviewed after creation.

## Findings by Severity

### Critical

No findings.

### High

- `src/apex_infinite/cli.py:1877` - Machine-output startup failures could write human text to stdout before the no-human-output renderer existed. Reproduced with a missing config path: stdout contained a JSONL `startup_begin` row followed by `Config file not found: ...`, violating the JSONL-only stdout contract for `--event-stream - --machine-output`. Event stream open failures also propagated as uncaught `EventStreamError` instead of a controlled CLI error. | Fix: added `CliStartupError`, `_exit_with_startup_error()`, startup error `error` event emission, machine-mode stdout suppression, and ClickException mapping for event stream open failures. Added tests for JSONL-only startup errors and no-traceback event stream open errors. | Status: FIXED

### Medium

- `src/apex_infinite/cli.py:1386` - Provider or manager LLM exceptions re-raised without emitting an `error` event, leaving machine-output consumers without a terminal failure event despite the session contract requiring error lifecycle events. | Fix: wrapped history summarization and manager decision LLM boundaries to emit bounded `error` events with stage, iteration, and error type before preserving the existing exception behavior. Added a regression test for summarizer failure. | Status: FIXED

### Low

No findings.

## Assumptions and Deliberate Non-Fixes

- Assumption: Because `spec.md` has no `Base Commit` field, `HEAD` (`6751558da5df70d3a5baef6347506526ef166f63`) is the required fallback base.
- Assumption: Event payload error details for provider and manager failures should avoid raw exception messages because provider exceptions can contain environment or endpoint details. The emitted runtime error events use `error_type`, `stage`, and `iteration` only.
- Deliberate non-fixes: None.

## Behavior Changes

- `--event-stream - --machine-output` now keeps stdout JSONL-only when config startup fails; the stream receives an `error` event instead of human text.
- Event stream open failures now surface as controlled Click errors instead of uncaught tracebacks.
- History summary and manager decision LLM failures now emit a bounded `error` event before re-raising, preserving existing failure semantics while satisfying the machine-readable lifecycle contract.

## Verification

- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_event_stream.py tests/test_cli_options.py -q` - PASS - 41 passed.
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v` - PASS - 173 passed.
- Formatter: `python -m black --check src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py src/apex_infinite/events.py tests/` - PASS - 13 files unchanged.
- Linter: `python -m pylint src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py src/apex_infinite/events.py` - PASS - 10.00/10.
- Whitespace: `git diff --check` - PASS - no output.
- ASCII: changed tracked and untracked file scan with `LC_ALL=C grep -n '[^[:print:][:space:]]'` - PASS - no output.
- LF endings: changed tracked and untracked file scan with `grep -n $'\r'` - PASS - no output.
- Root tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v` - PASS - 61 passed.
- Packaging sync: `bash .spec_system/scripts/analyze-project.sh --json` - PASS - plugin payload is current.
- Script smoke: `bash .spec_system/scripts/analyze-project.sh --json | jq .` - PASS - current session resolves to `phase00-session04-event-stream-boundary`.
- Script smoke: `bash .spec_system/scripts/check-prereqs.sh --json --env | jq .` - PASS - overall status `pass`.
- Runtime reproduction: missing config under `--event-stream - --machine-output` - PASS - stdout contains only JSONL `startup_begin` and `error` rows; stderr is empty.
- Final diff re-read: no remaining issues found in event API validation, no-human renderer suppression, CLI guardrails, subprocess event emissions, docs, or session artifacts.

## Summary

1. Reviewed 17 files in the final surface: 10 tracked modifications, 6 implementation/session untracked files, and this review report artifact.
2. Findings: 0 Critical, 1 High, 1 Medium, 0 Low; both findings were fixed.
3. No deliberately unresolved findings or blockers remain.
4. Verification passed: focused event/CLI tests, full CLI suite, Black, Pylint, Bats, plugin sync check, script smoke checks, whitespace, ASCII, LF, and runtime JSONL-only reproduction.
