# Security & Compliance Report

**Session ID**: `phase00-session04-event-stream-boundary`
**Reviewed**: 2026-07-03
**Result**: PASS

## Scope

**Files reviewed** (session deliverables only):
- `src/apex_infinite/events.py` - event emitter API, JSONL writer, payload validation
- `tests/test_event_stream.py` - event API, payload safety, loop event tests
- `docs/event-stream.md` - wrapper-facing event contract
- `src/apex_infinite/cli.py` - CLI flags, event lifecycle wiring, subprocess and DB events
- `src/apex_infinite/ui.py` - no-human-output renderer adapter
- `tests/test_cli_options.py` - event flag and stdout isolation tests
- `tests/test_subprocess_execution.py` - subprocess event tests
- `tests/test_renderer.py` - no-human-output renderer tests
- `README.md` - event stream user docs
- `docs/operator-runbook.md` - operator event stream guidance
- `docs/prompt-contract.md` - prompt and event boundary docs
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - event stream troubleshooting docs

**Review method**: Static analysis of session deliverables, dependency diff
inspection, focused security pattern search, and validation test evidence.

**Review evidence**:
- Command/check: `rg -n "shell=True|eval\\(|exec\\(|subprocess|sqlite3|execute\\(|CREATE TABLE|INSERT INTO|password|secret|token|api[_-]?key|Bearer|sk-|OPENAI|os\\.environ|event_stream|machine_output|NoHumanOutputRenderer|console\\.print|notify\\(" ...`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: Inspection found subprocess calls use argument lists, DB access remains in existing SQLite helpers, event payload validation rejects secret-looking keys and values, and docs/tests contain only environment placeholders or fake unsafe-string fixtures.
- Command/check: `git diff -- requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt pyproject.toml`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: No dependency file changes.
- Command/check: `sed -n '1,260p' src/apex_infinite/events.py` and `sed -n '220,340p' src/apex_infinite/events.py`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: Event payloads are JSON-validated, line-flushed, ASCII-serialized with `ensure_ascii=True`, and rejected for ANSI, Rich markup, frame glyphs, visual tokens, and secret-looking values.
- Command/check: `sed -n '1760,2075p' src/apex_infinite/cli.py`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: `--event-stream -` requires `--machine-output`; `--machine-output` requires `--event-stream`; machine mode selects `NoHumanOutputRenderer` and disables notifications.
- Command/check: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
  - Result: PASS
  - Evidence: 173/173 CLI tests passed, including event-stream guardrail, stdout-isolation, subprocess, renderer, history, prompt, and UI config coverage.

## Security Assessment

### Overall: PASS

| Category | Status | Severity | Details |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Injection (SQLi, CMDi, LDAPi) | PASS | -- | Subprocess execution continues to use an argument list through `run_codex_process`; no `shell=True`, `eval`, or dynamic Python `exec` was introduced. SQLite schema and queries remain in existing helpers. |
| Hardcoded Secrets | PASS | -- | No real secrets were introduced. Docs use environment placeholders such as `${OPENAI_API_KEY}`; tests use fake unsafe strings only to verify rejection. |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | PASS | -- | Event payloads reject secret-looking keys and values, avoid full provider config maps, and summarize prompts/responses by length rather than full content. |
| Insecure Dependencies | PASS | -- | No dependency manifests changed. |
| Security Misconfiguration | PASS | -- | Stdout JSONL is guarded by explicit `--machine-output`; human output and notifications are suppressed in machine-output mode. |

### Security Findings

No security findings.

## GDPR Compliance Assessment

### Overall: N/A

*N/A because this session introduced no personal data collection, storage, consent flow, user account data, or third-party personal-data transfer. Event streams are local operational records for project automation.*

**Categories reviewed**: Data Collection & Purpose, Consent Mechanism, Data
Minimization, Right to Erasure, PII in Logs, Third-Party Data Transfers.

### Personal Data Inventory

No personal data collected or processed in this session.

### GDPR Findings

No GDPR findings.

## Recommendations

None - session is compliant.
