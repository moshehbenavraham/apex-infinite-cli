## 1. Code Review Gate

### Status: PASS

**Report**: `code-review.md`
**Result**: RESOLVED
**Issues**: None unresolved. The review fixed one high finding for machine-output startup failures and one medium finding for missing LLM failure events.

## 2. Task Completion

### Status: PASS

**Tasks**: 21/21 complete
**Incomplete tasks**: None

## 3. Deliverables Verification

| `tests/test_event_stream.py` | Yes | PASS |
| `docs/event-stream.md` | Yes | PASS |
| `src/apex_infinite/cli.py` | Yes | PASS |
| `src/apex_infinite/ui.py` | Yes | PASS |

**Encoding issues**: None

## 5. Test Results

### Status: PASS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CLI Tests | 173 |
| Bats Tests | 61 |
| Total Tests | 234 |
| Passed | 234 |
| Failed | 0 |
| Coverage | Not collected by the configured validation commands |

**Failed tests**: None

Additional gates:
- Black check: PASS - 13 files unchanged.
- Pylint: PASS - 10.00/10.
- Plugin payload sync: PASS - current.
- Whitespace: PASS - `git diff --check` produced no output.
- Prerequisites: PASS - `check-prereqs.sh` overall status `pass`.

## 6. Database/Schema Alignment

### Status: N/A

**Evidence**: The session did not introduce DB-layer schema, migration,
constraint, index, seed, or durable data shape changes. `git diff --`
inspection of dependency manifests produced no output. Targeted diff inspection
of `src/apex_infinite/cli.py` found event emissions around existing DB logging and no
DDL, migration, or `cc_response` schema changes.

**Issues found**: None

## 7. Success Criteria

From `spec.md`:

**Functional requirements**: PASS
- `--event-stream PATH` writes line-buffered JSONL and flushes per event, verified by event API and CLI tests.
- Normal human output remains unchanged in file event-stream mode, verified by `test_event_stream_file_coexists_with_human_output_modes`.
- `--event-stream -` and `--machine-output` guardrails are enforced, verified by Click tests.
- Machine-output stdout is JSONL-only and notifications are disabled, verified by CLI and loop tests.
- Event names cover startup, iteration, history, manager, prompt, Codex, DB, help, completion, max-iteration, interrupt, timeout, and error paths, verified by tests and event registry inspection.
- Payload safety excludes secrets, ANSI, Rich markup, frame glyphs, renderer snapshots, and visual tokens, verified by event API tests and code inspection.
- Prompt routing, `build_codex_prompt()`, `execute_codex()` return text, and SQLite compatibility remain covered by prompt, subprocess, renderer, and DB tests.

**Testing requirements**: PASS
- Event API, CLI guardrails, dry-run loop, subprocess events, stdout isolation, prompt, renderer, history, UI config, and compatibility tests passed.

**Quality gates**: PASS
- ASCII/LF, project conventions, machine-output JSONL-only behavior, full CLI pytest, Black, and Pylint all passed.

**Categories spot-checked**: naming, file structure, error handling, comments,
testing, event stream boundaries, subprocess behavior, database compatibility,
and documentation updates.
