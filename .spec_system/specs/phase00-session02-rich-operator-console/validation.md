- `python -m pytest tests/ -v` passed with 61 tests.

## 6. Database/Schema Alignment
### Status: N/A
*N/A because the session introduced no DB schema, migration, persisted data shape, constraint, index, seed, or generated type changes.*

**Evidence**: `sed -n '528,620p' src/apex_infinite/cli.py && sed -n '1080,1155p' src/apex_infinite/cli.py` inspected `db_fetch_history()`, `db_log()`, parameterized SQL, and post-commit renderer calls. `tests/test_renderer.py::test_sqlite_history_stores_raw_values_without_renderer_labels` also passed as part of the full CLI test command.

**Issues found**: None.

## 7. Success Criteria
From `spec.md`:

**Functional requirements**:
- [x] Normal interactive output presents product-facing operator-console labels. Evidence: rendered width-80 UI command and `tests/test_operator_console.py` assertions.
- [x] Startup output shows project, provider, model, config, selected theme, dry-run state, and start context. Evidence: rendered width-80 UI command and full CLI tests.
- [x] Iteration output shows provider, model, project, iteration, elapsed time, dry-run state, and operation. Evidence: rendered width-80 UI command and `test_operator_console_sections_and_critical_states_at_supported_widths`.
- [x] Critical states have distinct semantic render states. Evidence: `tests/test_operator_console.py` covered manager decisions, prompt previews, agent output, DB writes, LLM retry, JSON fallback, help, interrupt, completion, max iterations, timeout, missing binary, generic error, non-zero exit, dry run, and start.
- [x] Plain, ASCII, compact, `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, and non-terminal paths remain readable. Evidence: `test_operator_console_fallback_modes_keep_labels_and_separator_rules`.
- [x] Separators are ASCII-safe and disabled in plain and compact modes. Evidence: fallback test and ASCII/LF scan.
- [x] SQLite schema, stored history semantics, prompt routing, and subprocess return semantics did not change. Evidence: `tests/test_renderer.py`, `tests/test_cli_options.py`, `tests/test_prompts.py`, and DB code inspection.

**Testing requirements**:
- [x] Existing prompt/routing tests pass unchanged. Evidence: full CLI pytest command includes `tests/test_prompts.py`.
- [x] Operator-console renderer tests cover 80, 100, and 120 columns. Evidence: `tests/test_operator_console.py` and `tests/test_renderer.py` parametrized width tests passed.
- [x] Styled, plain, ASCII, compact, `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, and non-terminal behavior covered. Evidence: fallback-mode pytest coverage passed.
- [x] Raw SQLite history isolation covered. Evidence: `test_sqlite_history_stores_raw_values_without_renderer_labels` passed.
- [x] Critical state coverage present. Evidence: `test_operator_console_sections_and_critical_states_at_supported_widths` passed.

**Quality gates**:
- [x] All files ASCII-encoded. Evidence: `file` and non-ASCII/control scan passed.
- [x] Unix LF line endings. Evidence: CRLF scan passed.
- [x] Code follows project conventions. Evidence: conventions spot-check, Black, pylint, tests, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] `pytest tests/ -v` passes from `./`. Evidence: 109 tests passed.
- [x] `black --check src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py tests/` passes from `./`. Evidence: Black reported 9 files unchanged.
- [x] `pylint src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py` passes from `./`. Evidence: pylint rated code 10.00/10.
- [x] Primary user-facing surfaces contain product-facing copy only. Evidence: rendered width-80 UI command printed `PASS product surface has no disallowed diagnostics`.

## 8. Conventions Compliance
### Status: PASS
*Skipped if no `.spec_system/CONVENTIONS.md` exists.*

**Categories spot-checked**: naming, file structure, error handling, comments, testing, rendering, prompt/routing, subprocess, database, documentation, and security/licensing.

**Convention violations**: None.

**Evidence**: `.spec_system/CONVENTIONS.md` was inspected. `black`, `pylint`, `pytest`, `python -m pytest tests/ -v`, `git diff --check`, ASCII/LF scans, DB code inspection, and renderer output inspection all passed.

## 9. Security & GDPR Compliance
### Status: PASS
**Full report**: See `security-compliance.md` in this session directory.

#### Summary
| Area | Status | Findings |
|------|--------|----------|
| Security | PASS | 0 issues |
| GDPR | N/A | 0 issues |

**Critical violations**: None.

## 10. Behavioral Quality Spot-Check
### Status: PASS
*Applies because this session produced application code.*

**Checklist applied**: Yes.
**Files spot-checked**:
- `src/apex_infinite/cli.py`
- `src/apex_infinite/ui.py`
- `tests/test_operator_console.py`
- `tests/test_renderer.py`
- `tests/test_cli_options.py`

**Categories spot-checked**: trust boundaries, resource cleanup, mutation safety, failure paths, and contract alignment.

**Violations found**: None.

**Fixes applied during validation**: None.

**Evidence**: `sed -n '537,820p' src/apex_infinite/ui.py`, `sed -n '528,620p' src/apex_infinite/cli.py`, `sed -n '1,240p' tests/test_operator_console.py`, and `sed -n '180,230p' tests/test_renderer.py` verified snapshot boundaries, explicit failure-state rendering, parameterized DB operations, and raw-history tests. Full CLI pytest passed.

## 11. UI Product-Surface Spot-Check
### Status: PASS
*Applies because this session changed user-facing CLI output.*

**Surfaces inspected**: Startup operator console, iteration frame, and history-write confirmation at 80 columns using renderer runtime output.
**Diagnostics found in primary UI**: None.
**Allowed debug/admin surfaces**: None.
**Fixes applied during validation**: None.

**Evidence**: `python - <<'PY' ... render StartupSnapshot, IterationSnapshot, DbLogSnapshot at width 80 and scan disallowed terms ... PY` printed `PASS product surface has no disallowed diagnostics`.

## Validation Result
### PASS

### Unresolved Failures And Blockers
None.
