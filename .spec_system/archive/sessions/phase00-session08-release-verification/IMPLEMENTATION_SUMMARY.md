# Implementation Summary

**Session ID**: `phase00-session08-release-verification`
**Completed**: 2026-07-03
**Duration**: 0.7 hours

---

## Overview

Completed final release verification for the Apex Infinite CLI upgrade. The
session verified workflow compatibility, UI flags and fallback modes, event
stream safety, SQLite history safety, optional Linux wrapper source mode,
documentation coverage, dependency boundaries, and clean-room release posture.
One narrow compatibility fix was shipped: redirected and non-TTY output no
longer receives the terminal BEL emitted by `notify()`.

## Technical Decisions

1. **Non-TTY notification guard**: Preserve interactive terminal BEL behavior,
   but suppress it for redirected stdout so logs, machine output, and wrapper
   paths remain free of live-only control bytes.
2. **Source-shippable wrapper posture**: Treat the optional PySide6/QML wrapper
   source path as verified while keeping binary/AppImage publication gated on
   future artifact-specific license, notice, checksum, and source/relink work.
3. **Clean-room evidence over assets**: Keep verification textual and
   command-backed; no copied reference code, shaders, images, icons, fonts, or
   profile data were added.

## Test Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests | 283 |
| Passed | 283 |
| Coverage | Not generated |

Additional passing gates included plugin payload sync, analyzer, prereqs,
black, pylint, py_compile, QML lint, offscreen wrapper smoke, pip-audit,
`git diff --check`, local doc link checks, clean-room scans, and ASCII/LF
checks.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Redirected and machine-readable output checks need to include live terminal
   notification paths, not only renderer code paths.
2. The optional wrapper lane can be source-shippable without weakening binary
   release gates.
3. Release ledgers work best when every PRD criterion maps to a command,
   inspection, focused fix, or explicit gate.

---

## Future Considerations

Items for future sessions:
1. Resolve cumulative WATCH items for local history retention, autonomous
   execution controls, provider transfer disclosure, and recurring dependency
   governance.
2. Complete artifact-specific binary/AppImage review before publishing any
   Linux visual wrapper binary.
3. Continue using raw JSONL events as the only wrapper integration boundary.
