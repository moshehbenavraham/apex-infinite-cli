## Findings by Severity

### Critical

No findings.

### High

No findings.

### Medium

- `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session03-subprocess-and-history-visibility/spec.md:5` and `.spec_system/specs/phase00-session03-subprocess-and-history-visibility/tasks.md:60` - Session metadata still described the session as not started and handed off to `implement` even though all 20 tasks were complete and the workflow had reached `creview`. This could send the next agent to the wrong workflow command. | Fix: updated the spec status to `Implemented` and changed the spec/tasks handoff to `creview`. | Status: FIXED
- `docs/history-db.md:77`, `docs/operator-runbook.md:65`, and `README.md:193` - The session changed user-facing history rendering to a compact ledger with `--history --verbose` expansion, but history docs still omitted those displayed semantics. `CONVENTIONS.md` requires history DB docs to move with displayed history semantics. | Fix: documented the render-time ledger, verbose history detail, and SQLite no-migration boundary in the README, history DB reference, and operator runbook. | Status: FIXED

### Low

- `tests/test_subprocess_execution.py:104` - The dry-run regression test guarded the legacy `subprocess.run` boundary but not the new active `run_codex_process()` helper. | Fix: patched the test to fail if either subprocess boundary is launched during dry-run. | Status: FIXED
- `src/apex_infinite/cli.py:85` - The new subprocess helper lacked clarifying type hints even though local conventions call for type hints on subprocess boundaries when they clarify contracts. | Fix: added `list[str]`, `str`, `int`, and `CodexProcessResult` annotations to `run_codex_process()`. | Status: FIXED

## Assumptions and Deliberate Non-Fixes

- Type checking is marked N/A because no mypy, pyright, pyre, pytype, or equivalent type-check command is configured in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements-dev.txt`.
- No standalone package metadata sync was required for this session.
- `src/apex_infinite/ui.py` keeps the explicit module-level `too-many-lines` pylint waiver added during implementation. Evidence: `implementation-notes.md` records that splitting the renderer is outside this session scope, and Pylint passes with the waiver.

## Behavior Changes

- Review repairs did not change runtime behavior beyond documenting existing new behavior and strengthening tests/types.
- Session implementation under review intentionally changes operator-visible behavior by adding subprocess state facts and rendering history as a compact ledger, per the session spec.

## Verification

- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v` - PASS - 133 tests passed.
- Linter: `python -m pylint src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py` - PASS - rated 10.00/10.
- Formatter: `python -m black --check src/apex_infinite/cli.py src/apex_infinite/ui.py tests/` - PASS - 11 files would be left unchanged.
- Type checker: N/A - no configured Python type checker found.
- Whitespace: `git diff --check` - PASS - no whitespace errors.
- Encoding: custom ASCII/LF scan over changed and untracked files - PASS - 13 files passed, including this report.
- Analyzer: `bash .spec_system/scripts/analyze-project.sh --json` - PASS - current session resolves to `phase00-session03-subprocess-and-history-visibility`.
- Final diff re-read: no remaining issues in reviewed code, tests, session files, or docs.

## Summary

1. Reviewed 13 uncommitted files covering subprocess execution, history rendering, CLI option tests, session artifacts, and history documentation.
2. Findings: 0 critical, 0 high, 2 medium, 2 low; all fixed.
3. Deliberately not fixed: type-checker execution is N/A because no type checker is configured; root skill payload sync is N/A because no root skill payload sources changed.
4. Verification passed: full CLI pytest suite, Black check, Pylint, whitespace check, ASCII/LF scan, analyzer state check, and final diff re-read.
