# Implementation Summary

**Session ID**: `phase00-session01-config-and-renderer-boundary`
**Completed**: 2026-07-03
**Duration**: 2.5 hours

---

## Overview

Completed the Apex Infinite CLI UI configuration and renderer boundary. The
session added validated display settings, built-in and custom theme support,
plain and ASCII fallbacks, compact rendering, Click display flags, renderer
helpers, raw-history safety tests, and operator documentation while preserving
prompt routing, subprocess return semantics, and SQLite compatibility.

## Technical Decisions

1. **Focused UI boundary**: Added `src/apex_infinite/ui.py` instead of expanding
   the main CLI module further, keeping configuration resolution and rendering
   testable.
2. **Plain and ASCII are separate modes**: Plain mode disables styled layout;
   ASCII mode keeps styled rendering but switches to ASCII-safe glyphs and
   overflow behavior.
3. **Explicit theme validation fails fast**: Invalid or empty explicit theme
   names now fail at the CLI/config boundary instead of silently falling back.
4. **Raw history boundary remains durable**: Renderer labels, ANSI sequences,
   Rich markup, and frame glyphs are excluded from SQLite history rows.

| Linter | PASS - pylint 10.00/10 |
| Plugin sync | PASS - generated payload check |
| Analyzer smoke | PASS |
| Prereq smoke | PASS |

## Lessons Learned

1. ASCII mode must be treated as a glyph constraint, not as a synonym for
   plain output.
2. Rich table overflow behavior can introduce non-ASCII characters unless
   explicitly constrained for ASCII-safe rendering.
3. Display helpers need raw-data boundary tests because UI labels can otherwise
   leak into durable history during refactors.

---

## Future Considerations

Items for future sessions:

1. Session 02 can build the richer operator console on top of the renderer
   boundary without changing workflow or storage contracts.
2. Session 03 should continue preserving captured stdout, stderr, exit code,
   timeout, and verbose behavior while improving live subprocess visibility.
3. Session 04 should use raw lifecycle facts rather than scraping human
   renderer output for machine-readable event streams.
