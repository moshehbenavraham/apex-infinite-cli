# Implementation Summary

**Session ID**: `phase00-session04-event-stream-boundary`
**Completed**: 2026-07-03
**Duration**: ~1 hour

---

## Overview

Session 04 added the Apex Infinite CLI event stream boundary for future
wrappers and machine consumers. The CLI now exposes lifecycle facts through an
importable event emitter API and opt-in JSONL streams while preserving normal
human output, prompt routing, subprocess return semantics, SQLite
compatibility, and raw durable history storage.

## Technical Decisions

1. **Publish events as a side channel**: Event streams mirror lifecycle facts
   without changing manager routing, prompt construction, subprocess behavior,
   DB persistence, or normal human rendering.
2. **Require explicit machine-output mode for stdout JSONL**: `--event-stream -`
   is valid only with `--machine-output`, and machine mode uses
   `NoHumanOutputRenderer` plus notification suppression to prevent stdout
   collisions.
3. **Keep the event API independent from Rich**: `src/apex_infinite/events.py`
   imports only standard library modules so future wrappers can consume events
   without terminal UI dependencies.
4. **Treat payload validation as a safety boundary**: Event payloads reject
   non-JSON values, ANSI escapes, Rich markup markers, frame glyphs, visual
   tokens, and secret-looking keys or values.

## Lessons Learned

1. Machine-readable stdout needs protection at startup as well as inside the
   main loop because config and stream-open failures can occur before the
   normal renderer path exists.
2. Event streams stay stable when they observe existing raw lifecycle facts
   instead of deriving state from rendered terminal output.
3. Payload validation is part of the product contract, not just test hygiene,
   because event streams can become wrapper and automation interfaces.

---

## Future Considerations

Items for future sessions:

1. Session 05 should add deterministic docs, samples, and runbook examples for
   the finalized event stream contract.
2. Sessions 06 and 07 can consume JSONL events directly when spiking and
   productizing the optional Linux visual wrapper.
3. Release verification should include event registry review and compatibility
   checks for stdout isolation.
