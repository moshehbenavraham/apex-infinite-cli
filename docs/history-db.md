# Apex Infinite CLI History DB

## Purpose

`history.db` is the CLI's local memory. It stores prior agent responses,
manager decisions, and special stop/help markers so the next iteration can
summarize recent context.

## Location

- Directory: `~/.apex-infinite/`
- Database file: `~/.apex-infinite/history.db`

The directory is created automatically on startup if it does not exist.

## Storage Mode

- SQLite
- `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`
- One table: `history`
- One index: `idx_path_created`

WAL improves durability and avoids blocking most reads while writes are active.

## Schema

The current schema is:

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `id` | `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` | Monotonic record ID |
| `path` | `TEXT NOT NULL` | Project path key used to scope history |
| `cc_response` | `TEXT` | Raw Codex response text for the iteration |
| `ai_decision_output` | `TEXT` | Manager output value, such as `implement` or `help` |
| `ai_decision_reason` | `TEXT` | Manager explanation for the decision |
| `help_or_done_msg` | `TEXT` | Special marker for `help` or `alldonebaby` cases |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | Insert time |

## Compatibility Note

The `cc_response` column name is legacy. Python variables now use
`agent_response`, but the database schema intentionally preserves the old
column name to avoid migrating existing history files.

## Path Normalization

History is grouped by the normalized `path` value stored in the database.

Before logging normal runs and before scoped history reads, the CLI:

1. Expands `~`
2. Verifies the directory exists
3. Strips any trailing slash
4. Re-appends a single trailing slash

That means `/tmp/project` and `/tmp/project/` collapse to the same history key
for both writes and `--history --path` lookups. Different symlinked or
alternate absolute paths will still be treated as different projects.

## Write Behavior

One row is written per loop iteration after a decision is made.

- Normal iteration: logs agent response, manager output, and manager reason
- `help`: logs the pause request and stores the help reason in
  `help_or_done_msg`
- `alldonebaby`: logs completion and stores `ALL DONE BABY!` in
  `help_or_done_msg`

## Read Behavior

The CLI uses the database in two ways:

- Decision loop: reads the most recent 15 rows for the current project
- `--history`: shows up to 50 rows, either globally or for one project path

Scoped `--history --path /path/to/project` uses the same normalized trailing
slash key as normal run logging. Unscoped `--history` does not filter by path.

History display is a render-time ledger. Each row derives a compact status,
project key, command, timestamp, reason, and response summary from the stored
columns. Default history output keeps reason and response text truncated for
80-column terminals. `--history --verbose` expands reason, response, and stored
state detail. These labels, summaries, truncation counts, and status values are
not written back to SQLite.

## Display-Time Status Labels

Status labels are derived at render time in this order:

1. If `help_or_done_msg` has text, that text is the status, truncated for
   display when needed.
2. If `ai_decision_output` is `alldonebaby`, status is `complete`.
3. If `ai_decision_output` is `help`, status is `help`.
4. If `ai_decision_output` has any other value, status is `iteration`.
5. If the row is sparse or legacy and has no command, status is `legacy`.

Current completed-run rows normally display `ALL DONE BABY!` because the
completion path stores that marker in `help_or_done_msg`. The `complete` label
appears only for `alldonebaby` rows where that stored marker is empty.

The compact summary line has this shape:

```text
#<id> <created_at> status=<status> project=<project-key> command=<manager-output>
```

`project-key` is the final path segment after trimming the stored path for
display. It does not rewrite the stored `path`.

## Truncation And Verbose Display

Default history output is optimized for 80-column terminals:

- Project path detail truncates around 48 characters.
- Manager reason truncates around 72 characters.
- Agent response truncates around 88 characters.
- Summary command text truncates around 28 characters.
- Shortened values include a character-count suffix.

`--history --verbose` expands the same render-time fields:

- Project path detail expands around 160 characters.
- Manager reason expands around 160 characters.
- Agent response expands around 220 characters.
- Stored state from `help_or_done_msg` is shown as an additional detail row.

Verbose history does not add a second flag and does not mutate storage.

## Raw Storage Boundary

SQLite rows store workflow facts only. They do not store:

- Rich markup.
- ANSI escapes.
- Box or frame glyphs.
- Theme token values.
- Rendered status labels.
- Truncation suffixes.
- History summaries.
- Wrapper state.

Use [history-ledger.txt](transcripts/history-ledger.txt) for a deterministic
compact and verbose history sample.

## History Summary Input Format

Before summarization, each fetched row is transformed into this structure:

```text
[Task N: <path>_<id>]
Agent: <cc_response>
Manager: Manager - Output: <ai_decision_output> | Reason: <ai_decision_reason>
```

Those blocks are then joined with blank lines and sent to the summarizer LLM.

## Useful Queries

Inspect the last 20 records:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.apex-infinite/history.db \
  "SELECT id, path, ai_decision_output, created_at FROM history ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

Inspect one project:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.apex-infinite/history.db \
  "SELECT id, ai_decision_output, ai_decision_reason, help_or_done_msg, created_at \
   FROM history WHERE path = '/home/user/projects/my-app/' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

Manual `sqlite3` queries must use the stored trailing-slash key. The CLI
normalizes `apex-infinite --history --path /home/user/projects/my-app` and
`/home/user/projects/my-app/` to that same key for you.

Count records by project:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.apex-infinite/history.db \
  "SELECT path, COUNT(*) FROM history GROUP BY path ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;"
```

## Operational Guidance

- Treat the DB as local state, not a shared source of truth across machines.
- Back it up before manual edits if you care about historical continuity.
- Prefer reading with `sqlite3` over editing rows directly.
- If you intentionally want a clean slate, archive or remove the DB file while
  the CLI is not running.
