## Final Release Position

| Surface | Position | Evidence |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Base terminal CLI | Source-shippable | Pytest, root workflow checks, CLI smoke matrix, initialized-project dry-run, history raw-data scan, event-stream scan, dependency audit, and docs audit passed. |
| Optional Linux visual wrapper source mode | Source-shippable | Wrapper tests, QML lint, offscreen smoke, optional dependency isolation, event-stream boundary, and source-mode docs passed. |
| Linux visual wrapper binary/AppImage | Binary-gated | No binary artifact is published in this session; future packaging must complete generated-bundle review, license review, notices, checksum publication, and source/relink instructions. |
| Clean-room posture | PASS for tracked source/docs | No tracked reference tree, no copied reference asset/source names, no binary/reference extensions, and excluded component hits are documentation only. |
| Security posture | WATCH | No critical/high findings and release checks passed; local history retention, autonomous execution flags, provider transfer disclosure, and recurring dependency governance remain open. |

## Raw-Data Safety Matrix

| Surface | T013/T015 Check | Reject Patterns | Expected Evidence | Status |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| JSONL event file | Run dry-run with `--event-stream <tmp.jsonl>` and parse every line with Python `json.loads`. | Invalid JSON, missing `version`, missing `event`, missing `payload`, non-ASCII bytes | 19 valid JSONL rows with event names from `EVENT_NAMES` | PASS |
| JSONL machine stdout | Run dry-run with `--event-stream - --machine-output` and parse stdout as JSONL. | Any human text line, Rich panel text, Click traceback, ANSI escape | 19 valid JSONL rows on stdout; stderr empty | PASS |
| JSONL guard failure | Run `--event-stream -` without `--machine-output`. | Silent success or mixed human/stdout JSON | Exit 2 usage error names the guard | PASS |
| Event payload safety | Scan event file and machine stdout for `\x1b[`, Rich markup, frame glyphs, visual token names, and secret-looking values. | ANSI escapes, `[bold]`, box/frame glyphs, `foreground`, `border`, `panel`, `separator`, `glyph`, API-key-like values | No matches in file or stdout JSONL | PASS |
| Event schema safety | Import `apex_infinite_events.EVENT_NAMES` and validate emitted names. | Unknown event names or missing required fields | All emitted event names are accepted | PASS |
| SQLite temp history | Run dry-run with isolated `HOME=<tmp>`, then inspect `<tmp>/.apex-infinite/history.db`. | Missing DB/table, schema drift, missing `cc_response` | History DB exists with legacy `cc_response` column intact | PASS |
| SQLite raw rows | Query `cc_response`, `ai_decision_output`, `ai_decision_reason`, and `help_or_done_msg` from temp DB. | ANSI escapes, Rich markup, frame glyphs, visual token names, renderer labels such as `status=` or `command=`, copied reference identifiers, secret-looking values | Stored row contains raw workflow facts only | PASS |

## CLI Smoke Matrix

Run all commands from `./` with an isolated temporary `HOME`
unless a row says otherwise. The target project path is
`/home/aiwithapex/projects/apex-infinite-cli`.

| ASCII | `HOME=<tmp> apex-infinite --path ... --start implement --dry-run --max-iterations 1 --ascii --plain` | Output uses code points 0-127 | PASS after F001 |
| Compact | `HOME=<tmp> apex-infinite --path ... --start implement --dry-run --max-iterations 1 --compact --plain` | Critical state labels remain visible with reduced spacing | PASS |
| Built-in themes | Loop `--theme auto`, `crt-green`, `crt-amber`, `ibm-dos`, `plain` with `--dry-run --max-iterations 1` | Accepted theme names render startup and dry-run state | PASS |
| `NO_COLOR` | `NO_COLOR=1 HOME=<tmp> apex-infinite --path ... --start implement --dry-run --max-iterations 1` | Plain fallback selected unless explicit theme is passed | PASS |
| `TERM=dumb` | `TERM=dumb HOME=<tmp> apex-infinite --path ... --start implement --dry-run --max-iterations 1` | Plain fallback selected | PASS |
| Non-TTY behavior | Run dry-run command with stdout redirected to a temp file | Plain fallback selected and no live-only terminal controls | PASS after F001 |
| Redirected output | Run `--plain --ascii --compact` dry-run with stdout redirected to a temp file | No ANSI escapes, non-ASCII bytes, or carriage-return-only live output | PASS after F001 |

## Release Blockers

None. Binary publication remains intentionally gated, but that is a documented
release position rather than a blocker for source-mode release verification.
