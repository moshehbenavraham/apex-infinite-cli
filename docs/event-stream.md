# Apex Infinite CLI Event Stream

## Purpose

The event stream is the machine-readable lifecycle boundary for wrappers,
tests, and automation. It reports raw operational facts as JSONL without
requiring consumers to parse Rich panels, plain text, history rows, or terminal
frames.

Normal human output remains the default. File event streams are a side channel.
Stdout JSONL is available only in explicit machine-output mode.

## CLI Modes

Write events to a file while keeping normal human output:

```bash
apex-infinite --path ~/projects/my-app/ --event-stream /tmp/apex-events.jsonl
```

Reserve stdout for JSONL and suppress human rendering, terminal bell, and
desktop notifications:

```bash
apex-infinite --path ~/projects/my-app/ --event-stream - --machine-output
```

Guardrails:

- `--event-stream -` requires `--machine-output`.
- `--machine-output` requires `--event-stream`.
- `--event-stream PATH` without `--machine-output` leaves normal human stdout
  unchanged and writes JSONL to `PATH`.
- Wrappers that need human-readable logs should use a file event stream and
  leave stdout/stderr for the normal terminal surface.
- Wrappers that need machine-readable stdout should use
  `--event-stream - --machine-output` and treat stdout as JSONL only.

## Event Shape

Each line is one JSON object:

```json
{"event":"startup_begin","payload":{"dry_run":true,"event_stream":true,"machine_output":false,"max_iterations":1},"timestamp":"2026-07-03T00:00:00Z","version":1}
```

Fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `version` | integer | Event schema version. Current value is `1`. |
| `event` | string | Stable snake_case event name. |
| `timestamp` | string | UTC timestamp in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` format. |
| `payload` | object | Raw JSON-safe event facts. |

Payload values are strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects only.
The emitter rejects non-JSON objects, non-finite floats, ANSI escapes, Rich
markup, frame glyphs, display token names, secret-looking keys, and
secret-looking values.

## Event Names

These names are emitted by the current CLI flow:

Startup and configuration:

- `startup_begin`
- `config_loaded`
- `ui_resolved`
- `project_resolved`
- `codex_flags_check_started`
- `codex_flags_check_failed`
- `codex_flags_check_finished`
- `startup`

Loop lifecycle:

- `iteration_started`
- `history_fetched`
- `history_summarize_started`
- `history_summarize_finished`
- `manager_decision_started`
- `manager_decision_finished`
- `prompt_built`
- `prompt_dispatched`

Codex subprocess:

- `codex_dry_run`
- `codex_started`
- `codex_finished`
- `codex_error`
- `codex_timeout`
- `response_summarized`

Storage, operator, and stop states:

- `db_log_started`
- `db_log_finished`
- `help_requested`
- `operator_interrupt_requested`
- `operator_interrupt_quit`
- `operator_input_received`
- `workflow_completed`
- `max_iterations_reached`
- `run_stopped`
- `event_stream_error`

The registry also accepts compatibility names for wrapper experiments and
future migrations: `config_resolved`, `history_summary_started`,
`history_summary_completed`, `manager_decision_completed`, `codex_completed`,
`codex_failed`, `output_summary`, `db_logged`, `completion`, and `error`.
Current code may emit `error` for startup, history-summary, or manager-decision
failures. Consumers should ignore unknown future event names only after logging
the raw event for diagnosis.

## Payload Principles

Events report bounded facts, not full terminal output:

- Project path key, provider name, model name, dry-run state, and iteration
  number when relevant.
- Prompt and response lengths instead of full prompt or full Codex output.
- Return code, elapsed seconds, timeout seconds, and output lengths for
  subprocess facts.
- DB log start/finish state around existing `db_log()` calls.
- Operator input action and input length, not the input text.

Events do not include:

- Provider API keys or full provider config maps.
- Rich renderables, ANSI escapes, frame glyphs, display labels, or renderer
  snapshots.
- Theme token values such as foreground, border, panel, or separator styles.
- Copied visual reference data, shaders, images, fonts, profile data, or
  terminal-emulator implementation details.

## Example File Stream

```jsonl
{"event":"startup_begin","payload":{"dry_run":true,"event_stream":true,"machine_output":false,"max_iterations":1},"timestamp":"2026-07-03T00:00:00Z","version":1}
{"event":"config_loaded","payload":{"config_path":"config.yaml","model_name":"qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q4_K_M","provider_name":"ollama"},"timestamp":"2026-07-03T00:00:01Z","version":1}
{"event":"ui_resolved","payload":{"ascii_only":false,"color_enabled":false,"compact":false,"constraint_reason":"non-terminal output","effect_level":"off","plain":true,"requested_theme":"auto","theme_name":"plain"},"timestamp":"2026-07-03T00:00:01Z","version":1}
{"event":"project_resolved","payload":{"project_path":"/home/user/projects/my-app/"},"timestamp":"2026-07-03T00:00:01Z","version":1}
{"event":"startup","payload":{"ceo_present":false,"config_path":"config.yaml","dry_run":true,"event_stream_path":"/tmp/apex-events.jsonl","machine_output":false,"max_iterations":1,"model_name":"qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q4_K_M","project_path":"/home/user/projects/my-app/","provider_name":"ollama","start_command":"implement","theme_name":"plain"},"timestamp":"2026-07-03T00:00:01Z","version":1}
```

See
[machine-output-events.jsonl](transcripts/machine-output-events.jsonl)
for a deterministic stdout JSONL sample that covers startup, UI resolution,
prompt dispatch, dry-run execution, DB logging, and stop events.

## Failure Behavior

If an event payload or write fails in normal human-output mode, the CLI prints
a visible `Event Stream` error through the renderer and keeps the workflow
decision path unchanged.

If a failure occurs in machine-output mode, the CLI tries to emit an
`event_stream_error` event with the failed source event and error type. If the
stream itself is no longer writable, no human fallback is printed to stdout.

## Wrapper Guidance

Wrappers should consume the JSONL stream or import `apex_infinite.events`
directly. They should not parse terminal output, Rich markup, history display
rows, or frame-like text. The event stream is append-only during a run and is
flushed after every event so wrapper state can update incrementally.

The event stream is the supported visual-wrapper state boundary. A wrapper may
show its own log viewport or styled panels, but those views must be derived
from events or an importable API, not from scraping Rich panels, plain output,
ANSI captures, or SQLite history display text.
